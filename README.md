Symfony coding exercise 1 
=======

# Overview

A simple Symfony project to show off your skills.
The application provides a REST interface to fetch entities.
Therer are 2 types of entities: articles and comments. Each comment belongs to an article. There can be multiple comments for the same article.

4 basic routes exist:

- `/api/article`
- `/api/article/{id}`
- `/api/comment`
- `/api/comment/{id}`

# System

Tested system requirements:

- Php 7.1.7
- MySql 5.7.20
- Composer 1.5.2

# Installation:

1. Clone the git repository
2. Create parameters.yml in `app/config/` (template `parameters.yml.dist`)
3. Install dependencies with composer
4. Create database with symfony console found in `bin/`
5. Configure webserver to server the `web` directory
6. Populate database with data. Some sample data can be found in `app/Resources/data/symfony.sql`.

# Your tasks 

1. Remove the unwanted attributes (like `__initializer__`, `__cloner__` and `__isInitialized__`) which are present in the json for some entities. IMPORTANT: do not disable lazy loading!
2. Change the routing config so that only GET requests are allowed to all routes.
3. For the routes where entities are requested by id, handle not found entities so that the error message is also returned in JSON format.
4. Extend the application so that for every article also the corresponding comments are returned.
5. Add a new route which fetches all comments of a specified article.
6. Allow all routes to be paginated with url parameters, e.g. `?page=1&per_page=5`. 
  * If no parameters are given via url, pagination should be disabled. 
  * When provided at least one of the parameters (page or per_page) pagination should be applied. 
  * Choose reasonable defaults for both parameters. 
  * When given impossible values (like page=-1) implement a fallback (e.g. page = 1). 
  * The solution should be easely extendable to new entites. I.e. if one adds a user entity, pagination must be applicable with as few additional code changes as possible. The pagination should also be possible with only small changes when getting the entities from an external service (like another REST interface) instead loading them from the database.
7. Provide the API responses also in XML format. Let the requester specify the desired format (XML or JSON) in the request header.
8. Adapt the application to support multiple types of articles. Instead of just articles there are now 2 different types. Both should support comments and can be accessable with the routes for articles.
  * Scientific Paper with the following fields:
    * title (string)
    * content (text)
    * author (string)
    * institution (string)
  * Reviews with the following fields:
    * title (string)
    * content (string)
    * link (string)
9. Refactor the code where you find it appropriate
